Time-series forecasting is a technique that utilizes historical and current data to predict future values over 
a period of time or a specific point in the future. By analyzing data that we stored in the past, we can make 
informed decisions that can guide our business strategy and help us understand future trends.

In this project different algorithms are used for forecasting like ARIMA, Simple moving Averages, SARIMAX etc.
